The claimant can claim up to 10 years since he/she graduated from 1st September 2013/2014. The Academic Year starts from 1st September to 31st August. For examples 
The claimant graduated on 01/09/2013 then they are eligible to claim between 01/09/2013 to 31/08/2023 for the eligible academic year.
The claimant graduated on 01/09/2015 then they are eligible to claim between 01/09/2015 to 31/08/2025 for the eligible academic year.
The claimant graduated on 01/09/2012 then they are NOT eligible to claim because starting QTS date for claim eligibility must be from 01/09/2013.
